# 🎬 Hudson Yards Studios — Investor Terms Sheet (Draft)

## Overview
**Hudson Yards Studios Inc. (“HYS”)** is a Delaware C-Corporation that develops, finances, and produces premium film and media projects.  
Each film is financed through its own **Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)**, allowing investors to participate directly in the success of individual titles.  
HYS uses digital ledger technology for record-keeping and tradability of investor interests—providing transparency and optional liquidity while maintaining a familiar, regulation-compliant investment experience.

## 1️⃣ SPV Structure & Jurisdiction
Each film will be financed through a dedicated **SPV**, typically a limited-liability or equivalent pass-through entity formed in whichever jurisdiction offers the most favorable production incentives and investor treatment (e.g., **New York State**, **New Jersey**, **Delaware**, or other).  

- The SPV is managed and wholly owned by **Hudson Yards Studios Inc.**  
- **Tokenholders are *not* members or equity owners** of the SPV.  
- Instead, each token represents a **Participation Right**—a contractual claim to defined cash flows (e.g., net-proceeds share) under a **Participation Rights Agreement (PRA)**.  
- Tokenholders have **no voting, governance, or liability exposure** within the SPV.  
- This structure:
  - Preserves eligibility for state film-production tax credits.  
  - Avoids pass-through tax reporting (no K-1s / 1099s).  
  - Limits investor liability to the amount invested.  
  - Keeps compliance simple as the offering scales internationally.

## 2️⃣ Investor Returns
| Category | Terms |
|-----------|-------|
| **Recoupment Priority** | 100 % of investor capital returned before any success fee to HYS. |
| **Preferred Return** | 5 % per year (non-compounded) on invested capital before HYS receives performance fees. |
| **Profit Participation** | After recoupment + preferred return, profits shared → **85 % investors / 15 % HYS**. |
| **Token Buybacks** | A portion of film revenues used for **open-market token repurchases**, letting investors choose when to exit. |

---

## 3️⃣ Fees & Alignment
| Fee Type | Standard | Investor-Friendly Adjustment |
|-----------|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Management Fee** | 1.5 % of raised capital per year | *Deferred until investors earn ≥ 1.5 % return that year* |
| **Success / Carry Fee** | 15 % of profits after recoupment + preferred return | *Paid only from profits, never from principal* |
| **Platform / Transaction Fee** | ≤ 0.25 % per trade | *Kept minimal to encourage liquidity* |
| **Studio Co-Investment** | 10–20 % of each SPV | *Ensures “skin in the game” alignment* |

HYS only earns meaningful income **after investors see returns**.

## 4️⃣ Use of Proceeds
Investor funds in each SPV are applied as follows:
- Film production and post-production costs  
- Marketing and distribution expenses  
- Limited management / administration fee to HYS (if performance trigger met)  
- Legal, compliance, and token-issuance costs (kept minimal)

---

## 5️⃣ Studio-Level Economics
Beyond film profits, HYS sustains operations through:
- **Factoring Revenue:** short-term financing of distributor receivables (10–20 % annualized yield)  
- **Festival & Membership Club:** the Hudson Yards Film Festival and Private Club for investors & creatives  
- **Equity Upside:** appreciation of HYS C-Corp shares (QSBS-eligible for early shareholders)

---

## 6️⃣ Investor Protections & Transparency
- **Third-party audits** of budgets and revenues  
- **Digital ledger visibility** for all project cashflows  
- **KYC-restricted transfer system** (compliant secondary markets)  
- **Studio co-investment** ensures mutual risk  
- **No hidden fees**—all economics disclosed upfront

---

## 7️⃣ Exit & Liquidity
- Investors may **hold** participation tokens for long-term exposure or **sell** them via regulated secondary markets (as they become available).  
- HYS will periodically execute **token buybacks** from film revenues, providing a built-in liquidity path.  
- Equity in HYS Inc. remains **QSBS-eligible**, offering favorable long-term tax treatment for early shareholders.
